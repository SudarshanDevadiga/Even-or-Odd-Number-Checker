# Even or Odd Number Checker

This is a simple C++ program that checks whether an entered integer is even or odd.

## How it works

1. The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. The program checks if the entered integer is even or odd using the modulus operator (`%`).
3. If the integer is divisible by 2 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`), it is even.
4. If the integer is not divisible by 2, it is odd.
5. The program outputs whether the entered integer is even or odd.
